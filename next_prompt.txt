This program is a 2D pixel Level editor in Rust. It supports multiple brush types and different types of tiles. Most importantly, it also supports "structures" which are multi-tile structures. Tiles and structures have metadata. All tiles belonging to the same structure have the same metadata. Currently, there are two types of structures: Platforms and Stairs. Platforms already automatically get created from tiles in the world. For now we will ignore platforms and focus on stairs. Stair tiles do not yet share metadata. Please search for (or add if necessary) the necessary functionality for tiles to point to a given structure and get the metadata from it.  If this functionality was not yet present, please update the platforms as well. Then make sure that all tiles which get created during the Stairs creation (on_mouse_release) point to the stairs structure.
