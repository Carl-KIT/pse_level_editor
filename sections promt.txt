Great! this is now working as expected. Next, I would like to introduce a pretty big change to the way Tiles work. I would like to go from the single-tiled approach to a section-based approach. This is to ensure better performance and easier management of components like a wall section. I would like all Tiles to connect to other tiles of the same kind to create sections. This would mean that for example, the ground in the world might be one big section. Whenever a tile is placed, it checks its surroundings for whether there's already a section of the same type next to it and tries to merge into it. If multiple sections are adjacent, it should connect the two sections, creating one bigger section which also includes the tile itself.
